# UK_Road_Accident
According to statistics from Brake Road Safety Charity, every year, more than 1.35 million people die on the world’s roads, and millions more are seriously injured. Road deaths are the 8th highest cause of death for people of all ages and is the number one killer of those between the ages of 5-29.

Using road accident data from all boroughs in England, United Kingdom for 2012 and 2022, I will perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Microsoft Excel to gain key insights for data-driven road safety decisions.

Microsoft Excel concepts used in this project include:
•	Data cleaning and transformation
•	Data Aggregation using pivot tables and formulas
•	Data visualization
